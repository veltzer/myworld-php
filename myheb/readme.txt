MyHeb plugin to WordPress.

== Description ==

This plugin adapts post headings and post content to the
hebrew language, reversing them. This allows you to manage
a blog where some of the posts are in hebrew and some of the
posts are in a different language.

Currently the implementation is quite simple - if the content
or the post header is in hebrew then they will be displaed in RTL,
otherwise they will be left alone. Maybe a tag will be introduced
later on to decide on these matters.

== Installation ==

These is no configuration at the moment.
