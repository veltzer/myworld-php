This document describes the integration between my code and wordpress
=====================================================================
Goals:
- That I could develop my code with no regard to wordpress.
- That my code could know if it is running inside wordpress or not in order to
	produce different output of required for wordpress.
- That it would be easy to run my php code from within wordpress.

Policy
======
- all includes are root oriented (from php downwards...) - is this still relevant ?!?

The event system:
=================
What is an event?
	A set of time-spans (each time space will have start and end and possibly more data).
	An attached set of companies.
	An attached set of courses.
	A set of participants.
	A name,remark, url, description, location and possibly some more data.
	A creator.
	A calendar to which it is attached.

The jQuery widget design descisions:
====================================
- controls will be called cont_[name] to make them easy to find.

Myworld database design:
========================
should all tables be named Tb something ?
for:
	to easily identify them in the code.
against:
	make queries cumbersome.
descision:
	for

should fields be named f_something ?
pro:
	to easily identify them in the code.
against:
	make queries cumbersome.
descision:
	against

should we have person groups and only refere to person groups from views ?
for:
	if I see lots of movies with David then I will only create the group once
	and keep refering to it.
against:
	each time I create a person I also have to create a group of 1 in order to refer
	to him ?!?
descision:
	for.

slugs are used in myworld quite a bit to keep external links to blobs and other system resources stable.
currently it is used for blobs.

some database conventions:
all tables have "id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY"
all tables are TbCamelCase with words which are legal.
fileds are FdCamelCase with words which are legal. 
if a field refers to a table Foo it should have the name FdPurposeFooId

table names:
db - database schema definition in a database.
id - identity data (contant and person information).
lc - location data.
rs - resources: tags, images, texts, colors.
tv - title/view information.
wg - word groups.
wk - works.


The design of the works subsystem
=================================
problems:
	I cannot have the same work in two different formats.
	Example: Charles Darwin/On the Origin of Species
	I have read this one in text and audio format and so I had to insert
	the reason is the following:
	UNIQUE KEY `avoid_dups` (`externalId`,`externalCode`),
	contraint on the TbWkWorkExternal table.
	How should we solve this?
		It looks like we will have to split the Work table into Work and WorkManifestation
		Work will have the name of the work
		while WorkManifestation will carry the type.
		TbWkWorkExternal will keep pointing to Work although we may need external ids
		for work manifestations as well.
		This will enable us to bring back the constraint on TbWkWorkExternal.
		Q: Should work manifestations have unique on (work,type)? No - there could be two
			audio book recordings of the same book or two prints of the same book.
