Go to the jquery-ui site and download it.
unzip it and only take the js and css folders (this means remove index.html and
	'developement-bundle').
Replace EVERYTHING under my own jquery folder with these two folders.
Change the symbolic links to point to the new jquery and jquery-ui.
Go to pages using it and change three links:
	- jquery.js
	- jquery-ui.js
	- jquery-ui theme link.

There is no need to install jquery seperately since jquery-ui brings jquery with it!
