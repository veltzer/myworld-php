- divide my plugin into two plugins:
	- one that handles the hebrew stuff.
	- one that handles the myworld stuff.
	- blog about the hebrew plugin.

- import all company images into my database.
- permalinks look bad. A link to an article looks like:
	http://veltzer.net/blog/blog/2010/07/02/grep-is-broken-use-perl-instead/
	The extra "blog" there is redundant. Do something about it.
- fix up my favicon after learning some gimp howto.
- GetBlob.php should be based on include/blob.php
	and so should be lilypond fragment.
	There I would have sugar functions for creating a link for a blog
	and extracting the data of a blob requested.
- take an image of me and pass it though some gimp folder and put it on the side bar
	of my site.
- put some info on the about page.
- put a todo page on the blog with stuff that I want to do in the blog
	and handle it from there.
- check what's the status of a hebrew spell checker in my blog...
	(do I have one ? does it work? what about the english one ?)
- add images to my political posts (the hebrew ones).
