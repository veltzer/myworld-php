now:
====
new movie system:
=================
the submit button does NOT submit anything!!!
	fix it.

fix the fact that moving past a select changes it's value.
style my new selection widget.
allow descriptions on LocationsLcNamed, return them in the json object
	and render them with a _render function.
whenever an imdb id is inserted, go fetch the movie data from the server
	(use phpimdb) and show it on the page.
add spell checking for the reviews.
do the date box better (add a special widget with a "now" button and +/- buttons).

date selection box ideas:
=========================
add the following buttons: day+, day-, hour+, hour-, etc...
This will allow the user to manipulate the day easily.

there is a problem with the styles (classes). Move between the fields and you will see
	the problem. I think it's because I am not using the jqueryui classes right.
control focus movement, after review should go to submit and back to name.

new event system:
=================
- reporting of errors and disable of button of submit in relation to errors.
- display icons in the selection boxes.
- turn the selection boxes into combos.
- add multi selection of (times and dates),(courses),(comanies).
- make the insert finally work!!!

build and folders:
==================
- add gpp support for the misc folder.
- the wp_script should pass through gpp.

publication
===========
- "make public" to upload my plugins and themes to the wordpress community.
- put links for these in my computing section.
- add git for the trees that I'm developing these plugins in to my git repostory.
	- link to these trees.

installation
============
- reinstall my blog and see exactly what is needed to get it to it's current state.
- make a script that installs my blog from scratch:
	It opens wp-3.0.1, adds all the plugins and themes, and adds any needed configuration
	files etc...
	This will enable me to make an easy script to transfer my blog to another host.
- write a script that copies the blog to a remote machine (veltzer.org for instance).
- permalinks look bad. A link to an article looks like:
	http://veltzer.net/blog/blog/2010/07/02/grep-is-broken-use-perl-instead/
	The extra "blog" there is redundant. Do something about it.
	this is because of the multi-site feature - when I'll get ridd of it the
	permalinks will be better.

analytics:
==========
- get ridd of google analytics and instead get a plugin that does all of those statistics
"in house" well.
- how to I use google analytics for my blobs ?
	Maybe I should just have my own analytics ? A table which records each person
	accessing the blob table, the ip, the browser and shit, and then have some
	analysis about it?

blog content:
=============
- fix up my favicon after learning some gimp howto.
- take an image of me and pass it though some gimp folder and put it on the side bar
	of my site.
- put some info on the about page.
- put a todo page on the blog with stuff that I want to do in the blog
	and handle it from there.
- check what's the status of a hebrew spell checker in my blog...
	(do I have one ? does it work? what about the english one ?)
- add images to my political posts (the hebrew ones).

database:
=========
- separate views from TbWkWorks.
- separate reviews from TbWkWorks.
- separate urls for TbWkWorks.
- add tags to TbWkWorks.
