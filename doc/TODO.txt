- wrap phps in wordpress plugins
	- write scripts to install the plugins to wordpress folder.
- import all company images into my database.
- get ridd of setup and wp-setup if I can...
- move this to my own folder and leave a symlink here.
- picasa albums are showing way too low.
	fix it.
- permalinks look bad. A link to an article looks like:
	http://veltzer.net/blog/blog/2010/07/02/grep-is-broken-use-perl-instead/
	The extra "blog" there is redundant. Do something about it.
