- import all company images into my database and get it out of the plugin folder.
- GetBlob.php should be based on include/blob.php
	and so should be lilypond fragment.
	There I would have sugar functions for creating a link for a blog
	and extracting the data of a blob requested.
- add google analytics or any other type of analytics I am using to GetBlob.php.

Lilypond section
================
- audio playing looks bad for hebrew titles. fix it.
- add links to performances embedded as youtube videos.

Calendar project:
=================
- add my own events table in the database.
	An event:
		begin time, end time, name, company affiliated, course affiliated
	import historical data.
- show events from date to date in the blog under 'calendar'.

- in the future improve the UI to look like the real professional calendars.

Company cloud project, company histogram project
================================================
- Create a cloud of the companies that I teach with the icons of the companies.
Size of the icon is the number of hours I taught that company.
- Do the same for my courses.
- Create a company historgram and course histogram (same as above).

About page:
===========
The links in the about page should come from the database under some kind of
tag like 'web presense'.
