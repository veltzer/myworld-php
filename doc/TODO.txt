now:
====
- put model into the graphs that reads from server.

images
======
- make image handling more streamlined:
	add dialog for new organization to myworld.
		this one will have:
			slug
			name
			url
			imageUrl (for where I got the image)
		it will get the image via HTTP and load it into orig.
		it will create the big and the small images from it
		it will insert into two tables: TbOrganization and TbImage
		and will connect the two.

make the work view and review dialogs show groups and not people.
add a dialog to create a group, give it a name and add people to it.

add the ability to have two instances of the same work (one in audio, one in video
	for instance).

import all lectures in my audio archive into works.
	How do I decide if they are TTC ? I Don't know.
	How do I decide if they are audio books ? I Don't know.
write a script that allows me to separate stuff to a new table.

statistics:
===========
use open chart http://teethgrinder.co.uk/open-flash-chart/ to show stats from my database.
doesnt matter which for now.
use the canvas API in HTML5 to show stats on my pages.

notes support:
==============
add a notes subsystem.
notes are just arbitrary length pieces of text.
They will be stored as blobs in the database.
They will be editable by an outside editor easily.
They will be searchable (full text searching using some kind of facility).
They will have tags assigned to them.
	Copy ideas from how wordpress uses tags.
import all of my computer notes into that system.

Location support:
=================
add x,y position to locations.
add street, city, whatever to locations.
add dialog to add new locations.
add dialog to edit a loction.

Social site support
===================
add support for flickr, reddit, imdb, fora.tv

php layer:
==========
find some kind of database layer for php (cake ?!? , others ?!?)

mysql wrappers:
===============
- add debug facility to see the queries they generate.

code quality:
=============
- organize the files in the /public folder (it's a mess).

date selection box ideas:
=========================
add the following buttons: day+, day-, hour+, hour-, etc...
This will allow the user to manipulate the day easily.

look and feel:
==============
there is a problem with the styles (classes). Move between the fields and you will see
	the problem. I think it's because I am not using the jqueryui classes right.
control focus movement, after review should go to submit and back to name.

build:
======
- add gpp support for the misc folder (also has hardcoded paths).
- the wp_script should pass through gpp (it repeats the blog dir and other variables a lot).
- the version number of plugins appear in many source files. Add gpp support for that as well.

publication
===========
- "make public" to upload my plugins and themes to the wordpress community.
- put links for these in my computing section.
- add git for the trees that I'm developing these plugins in to my git repostory.
	- link to these trees.

installation
============
- reinstall my blog and see exactly what is needed to get it to it's current state.
- make a script that installs my blog from scratch:
	It opens wp-3.0.1, adds all the plugins and themes, and adds any needed configuration
	files etc...
	This will enable me to make an easy script to transfer my blog to another host.
- write a script that copies the blog to a remote machine (veltzer.org for instance).
- permalinks look bad. A link to an article looks like:
	http://veltzer.net/blog/blog/2010/07/02/grep-is-broken-use-perl-instead/
	The extra "blog" there is redundant. Do something about it.
	this is because of the multi-site feature - when I'll get ridd of it the
	permalinks will be better.

analytics:
==========
- get ridd of google analytics and instead get a plugin that does all of those statistics
"in house" well.
- how to I use google analytics for my blobs ?
	Maybe I should just have my own analytics ? A table which records each person
	accessing the blob table, the ip, the browser and shit, and then have some
	analysis about it?

blog content:
=============
- fix up my favicon after learning some gimp howto.
- take an image of me and pass it though some gimp folder and put it on the side bar
	of my site.
- put some info on the about page.
- put a todo page on the blog with stuff that I want to do in the blog
	and handle it from there.
- check what's the status of a hebrew spell checker in my blog...
	(do I have one ? does it work? what about the english one ?)
- add images to my political posts (the hebrew ones).

new work page:
==============
- external code should be validated according to it's type (imdb, ttc, whatever).
- by default the selector for external code id should be non selected which means that the
	external code box should be disabled and the value submitted for it should be null.

new person->work page:
======================
- add organization id.
- check to see that the user either put an organization or a person (but not both!).
- allow to collect a number of roles.
- allow auto comletion on all fields.

new event page:
===============
- reporting of errors and disable of button of submit in relation to errors.
- display icons in the selection boxes.
- turn the selection boxes into combos.
- add multi selection of (times and dates),(courses),(comanies).
- make the insert finally work!!!

new movie page:
===============
fix the fact that moving past a select changes it's value.
style my new selection widget.
allow descriptions on LocationsLcNamed, return them in the json object
	and render them with a _render function.
whenever an imdb id is inserted, go fetch the movie data from the server
	(use phpimdb) and show it on the page.
add spell checking for the reviews.
do the date box better (add a special widget with a "now" button and +/- buttons).

new company page:
=================
import company images into my database (originals and biggs too).
create a "new company" dialog.
remove the importing of company data script.
add the imageUrl data for all the companies that I already have.

Schema changes:
===============
add images to people either by file upload or url.
in TbWkWorkView change [start|end]ViewDate to [start|end].
make TbWkWorkView viewer be a single person and not a ref to TbIdGrp.
get ridd of the TbIdGrp tables (if no one is using them).
have the ability to have many persons connected with a single view.
have the ability to have many persons connected with a single review.

Misc issues:
============
UTF doesn't show well in titles of articles. Check it out.

javascript:
===========
take a loot at: myworld/javascript/myworld_jquery.js - the calendar part should be part of the calendar support and not of myworld in general.

build system:
=============
- when doing "make" it should also import stuff into the database.
	(call the import script).

more data
=========
- load mime data into the database.
- put all the data that I have in the info folder into the database
	and get ridd of that folder.
- load the key file from twitter into the database as a blob
	and use it that way.
	(create a table of blobs for that with a string as well as int as keys).

PHP stuff
=========
- create a php script that shows statistics about the database:
	lists all tables and shows how many records they have.
- print length and size in human readable form (are there modules
	like that in PHP ? find, install and use them).
	add stats about total size and total length.
- make the works.php page use groups for real.
	how do I test that ? Plug in some video data too.
- each page generated should have statistics about how long
	it took to generate it.

General development
===================
- document how to produce field utilization and cut fields in size.
- add a flag to make warnings into errors and document it (in the database).

backups:
========
- do a php that shows when backups of the db were taken. (TbBackup).
- allow user of the php to take a backup from the UI.

Future database features (stuff that is currently not even in the database)
===========================================================================
- add tags to the works. Make tags be arranged in a graph.
	if one searches for tag A then he will also find everything that
	is tagged under B if A->B and everything tagged C if B->C.
- have a field next to the length of each work saying what was the source for that
	length.
- correct the date not to be a string (which date?!?).
- add images to works and fill them out (and display them ofcourse).
- names should be per language. This goes for peoples names, work names and other
	names I have in the database.

Concrete Database changes (database changes in current tables)
==============================================================
- multiple viewers per review.
- have person names in different languages.
