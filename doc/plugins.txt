here are the plugins that I am ACTUALLY using. All other plugins can be removed:

The names here are in ** folder ** format which means that they are the names
which are shown if you list the content of $WP/wp-content/plugins

Akismet - for SPAM
All in One SEO Pack - URLS, SEO etc...
Google Analyticator - google analytics.
MyHeb, MyWorld - my own.
Shashin - for images from picasa and videos from youtube.
SoundCloud Shortcode - for soundcloud.
Toppa Plugins Libraries for WordPress - this is a prerequisite for Shashin.
Twitter Widget Pro - for the twitter sidebar
WP-Syntax - for the code snipplets.

I install them via the web interface (except my own plugins).
