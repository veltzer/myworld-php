- import all company images into my database.
- permalinks look bad. A link to an article looks like:
	http://veltzer.net/blog/blog/2010/07/02/grep-is-broken-use-perl-instead/
	The extra "blog" there is redundant. Do something about it.
- fix up my favicon after learning some gimp howto.
- GetBlob.php should be based on include/blob.php
	and so should be lilypond fragment.
	There I would have sugar functions for creating a link for a blog
	and extracting the data of a blob requested.
