- when mouse overs over titles which have been changed to hebrew by this
plugin then it shows not only the content of the title but also the wrapping
div. make this behave better.

- this plugin is over simplistic in it's approach - it simply scans the text for
hebrew. Allow the user to say what is hebrew or what is not using a tag.

- allow comments in hebrew. 

- the plugin should not reply on the css styles (heb{title,content,except}) which are
in the mytheme theme but rather be self contained.

- comments issues:
	comments do not look good if they are on hebrew posts.
	They do not have hebrew translations.
	They do not by default accepts right to left text.
	Make my hebrew plugin handle this...
