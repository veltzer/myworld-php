publication
===========
- "make public" to upload my plugins and themes to the wordpress community.
- put links for these in my computing section.
- add git for the trees that I'm developing these plugins in to my git repostory.
	- link to these trees.

installation
============
- reinstall my blog and see exactly what is needed to get it to it's current state.
- make a script that installs my blog from scratch:
	It opens wp-3.0.1, adds all the plugins and themes, and adds any needed configuration
	files etc...
	This will enable me to make an easy script to transfer my blog to another host.
- write a script that copies the blog to a remote machine (veltzer.org for instance).
- permalinks look bad. A link to an article looks like:
	http://veltzer.net/blog/blog/2010/07/02/grep-is-broken-use-perl-instead/
	The extra "blog" there is redundant. Do something about it.
	this is because of the multi-site feature - when I'll get ridd of it the
	permalinks will be better.

analytics:
==========
- get ridd of google analytics and instead get a plugin that does all of those statistics
"in house" well.
- how to I use google analytics for my blobs ?
	Maybe I should just have my own analytics ? A table which records each person
	accessing the blob table, the ip, the browser and shit, and then have some
	analysis about it?

blog content:
=============
- fix up my favicon after learning some gimp howto.
- take an image of me and pass it though some gimp folder and put it on the side bar
	of my site.
- put some info on the about page.
- put a todo page on the blog with stuff that I want to do in the blog
	and handle it from there.
- check what's the status of a hebrew spell checker in my blog...
	(do I have one ? does it work? what about the english one ?)
- add images to my political posts (the hebrew ones).
