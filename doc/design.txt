This document describes the integration between my code and wordpress
=====================================================================
Goals:
- That I could develop my code with no regard to wordpress.
- That my code could know if it is running inside wordpress or not in order to
	produce different output of required for wordpress.
- That it would be easy to run my php code from within wordpress.

Policy
======
- all includes are root oriented (from php downwards...) - is this still relevant ?!?

The database
============

The event system:
=================
What is an event?
	A set of time-spans (each time space will have start and end and possibly more data).
	An attached set of companies.
	An attached set of courses.
	A set of participants.
	A name,remark, url, description, location and possibly some more data.
	A creator.
	A calendar to which it is attached.

Should we have person groups ?
==============================
For:
	- if I see lots of movies with David then I will only create the group once
	and keep refering to it.

Against:
	- each time I create a person I also have to create a group of 1 in order to refer
	to him ?!?

Descision:
	For.


The jQuery widget design descisions:
====================================
- controls will be called cont_[name] to make them easy to find.
