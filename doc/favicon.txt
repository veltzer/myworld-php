This is documentation about using the favicon here...
=====================================================
- Ultimately the favicon should be in the database.
- Currently it is not.
- My first solution was to put it here in the build directory (not as part of any wordpress
plugin but rather as a standalone file) and have the "make install" process install it
at the root of my website (usually /var/www).
- This was a stupid solution since it is too much hardcoded.
- I found, by scanning wordpress plugins that deal with the favicon issue, that there is
a way for a page to set it's own favicon.
- This is done by a syntax like this:
	echo "<link rel='SHORTCUT ICON' type='image/x-icon' href='".plugins_url('resources/favicon.ico',__FILE__)."' />\n";
- This is how I got to the current situation: the favicon is part of the plugin (still not in the database) but has nothing to do with the build system. Better.

What is yet to do ?
- put the favicon in the database.
- put the right link to the GetBlob.php script instead of it's name.
- get it out of the plugin (make the plugin lighter).
