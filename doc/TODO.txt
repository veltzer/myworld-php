now:
====
	import all lectures in my audio archive into works.
		How do I decide if they are TTC ? I Don't know.
		How do I decide if they are audio books ? I Don't know.

	write a script that allows me to separate stuff to a new table.

	do a dialog for entering a lecture.
		use that to enter the lectures that I am now hearing (the Russian
			Revolution).

php layer:
==========
find some kind of database layer for php (cake ?!? , others ?!?)

mysql wrappers:
===============
- add debug facility to see the queries they generate.

code quality:
=============
- organize the files in public (it's a mess).

pages to be done:
=================
- add person - a page that adds a person to the system.
	Name, middle name, last name.
- add person to work
	a page that adds a person as a contributor to a work.
- add review - a page that adds a review to a work.
	(by me, ofcourse).
- add view - a page that adds a view to a work.

new movie page:
===============
fix the fact that moving past a select changes it's value.
style my new selection widget.
allow descriptions on LocationsLcNamed, return them in the json object
	and render them with a _render function.
whenever an imdb id is inserted, go fetch the movie data from the server
	(use phpimdb) and show it on the page.
add spell checking for the reviews.
do the date box better (add a special widget with a "now" button and +/- buttons).

date selection box ideas:
=========================
add the following buttons: day+, day-, hour+, hour-, etc...
This will allow the user to manipulate the day easily.

there is a problem with the styles (classes). Move between the fields and you will see
	the problem. I think it's because I am not using the jqueryui classes right.
control focus movement, after review should go to submit and back to name.

new event page:
===============
- reporting of errors and disable of button of submit in relation to errors.
- display icons in the selection boxes.
- turn the selection boxes into combos.
- add multi selection of (times and dates),(courses),(comanies).
- make the insert finally work!!!

build and folders:
==================
- add gpp support for the misc folder.
- the wp_script should pass through gpp.

publication
===========
- "make public" to upload my plugins and themes to the wordpress community.
- put links for these in my computing section.
- add git for the trees that I'm developing these plugins in to my git repostory.
	- link to these trees.

installation
============
- reinstall my blog and see exactly what is needed to get it to it's current state.
- make a script that installs my blog from scratch:
	It opens wp-3.0.1, adds all the plugins and themes, and adds any needed configuration
	files etc...
	This will enable me to make an easy script to transfer my blog to another host.
- write a script that copies the blog to a remote machine (veltzer.org for instance).
- permalinks look bad. A link to an article looks like:
	http://veltzer.net/blog/blog/2010/07/02/grep-is-broken-use-perl-instead/
	The extra "blog" there is redundant. Do something about it.
	this is because of the multi-site feature - when I'll get ridd of it the
	permalinks will be better.

analytics:
==========
- get ridd of google analytics and instead get a plugin that does all of those statistics
"in house" well.
- how to I use google analytics for my blobs ?
	Maybe I should just have my own analytics ? A table which records each person
	accessing the blob table, the ip, the browser and shit, and then have some
	analysis about it?

blog content:
=============
- fix up my favicon after learning some gimp howto.
- take an image of me and pass it though some gimp folder and put it on the side bar
	of my site.
- put some info on the about page.
- put a todo page on the blog with stuff that I want to do in the blog
	and handle it from there.
- check what's the status of a hebrew spell checker in my blog...
	(do I have one ? does it work? what about the english one ?)
- add images to my political posts (the hebrew ones).

database structure:
===================
- separate ids from TbWkWorks.

new work page:
==============
- external code should be validated according to it's type (imdb, ttc, whatever).
- by default the selector for external code id should be non selected which means that the
	external code box should be disabled and the value submitted for it should be null.

new person->work page:
======================
- add organization id.
- check to see that the user either put an organization or a person (but not both!).
- allow to collect a number of roles.
- allow auto comletion on all fields.
