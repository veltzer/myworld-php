Adding a new album:
- go to tools->shashin->picasa/google+
	Add my album again:
	https://picasaweb.google.com/mark.veltzer
- now you can use the album.

I use shashing with columns="2" because more looks bad on non wide screens (regular desktops,
	laptops and tablets).

I really should get ridd of shashin, it's not as good as I want it but it's the best I found so far.
