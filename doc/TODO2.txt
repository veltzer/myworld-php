build system:
=============
- when doing "make" it should also import stuff into the database.
	(call the import script).

more data
=========
- load mime data into the database.
- put all the data that I have in the info folder into the database
	and get ridd of that folder.
- load the key file from twitter into the database as a blob
	and use it that way.
	(create a table of blobs for that with a string as well as int as keys).

PHP stuff
=========
- create a php script that shows statistics about the database:
	lists all tables and shows how many records they have.
- print length and size in human readable form (are there modules
	like that in PHP ? find, install and use them).
	add stats about total size and total length.
- make the works.php page use groups for real.
	how do I test that ? Plug in some video data too.
- each page generated should have statistics about how long
	it took to generate it.

General development
===================
- document how to produce field utilization and cut fields in size.
- add a flag to make warnings into errors and document it (in the database).

backups:
========
- do a php that shows when backups of the db were taken. (TbBackup).
- allow user of the php to take a backup from the UI.

Future database features (stuff that is currently not even in the database)
===========================================================================
- add tags to the works. Make tags be arranged in a graph.
	if one searches for tag A then he will also find everything that
	is tagged under B if A->B and everything tagged C if B->C.
- have a field next to the length of each work saying what was the source for that
	length.
- correct the date not to be a string (which date?!?).
- add images to works and fill them out (and display them ofcourse).
- names should be per language. This goes for peoples names, work names and other
	names I have in the database.

Concrete Database changes (database changes in current tables)
==============================================================
- multiple viewers per review.
- have person names in different languages.
