Not typing password for sudo

Having to type a password each time you do sudo is a major drag, although good for security. If you understand the risks and still want to go ahead and remove the need to type a password here is how you do it:

- add yourself to the sudo group:
	sudo adduser mark sudo
- add a file in /etc/sudoers.d
- the content of the file should be:
=====================
# Allow members of group sudo to not need a password on any command
%sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL
=====================
- chmod the file to 0440
- thats it
