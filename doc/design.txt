This document describes the integration between my code and wordpress
=====================================================================
Goals:
- That I could develop my code with no regard to wordpress.
- That my code could know if it is running inside wordpress or not in order to
	produce different output of required for wordpress.
- That it would be easy to run my php code from within wordpress.

Policy
======
- all includes are root oriented (from php downwards...) - is this still relevant ?!?

The event system:
=================
What is an event?
	A set of time-spans (each time space will have start and end and possibly more data).
	An attached set of companies.
	An attached set of courses.
	A set of participants.
	A name,remark, url, description, location and possibly some more data.
	A creator.
	A calendar to which it is attached.

The jQuery widget design descisions:
====================================
- controls will be called cont_[name] to make them easy to find.

Myworld database design:
========================
should all tables be named Tb something ?
for:
	to easily identify them in the code.
against:
	make queries cumbersome.
descision:
	for

should fields be named f_something ?
pro:
	to easily identify them in the code.
against:
	make queries cumbersome.
descision:
	against

should we have person groups and only refere to person groups from views ?
for:
	if I see lots of movies with David then I will only create the group once
	and keep refering to it.
against:
	each time I create a person I also have to create a group of 1 in order to refer
	to him ?!?
descision:
	for.

slugs are used in myworld quite a bit to keep external links to blobs and other system resources stable.
currently it is used for blobs.

some database conventions:
all tables have "id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY"
all tables are TbCamelCase with words which are legal.
fileds are FdCamelCase with words which are legal. 
if a field refers to a table Foo it should have the name FdPurposeFooId

table names:
db - database schema definition in a database.
id - identity data (contant and person information).
lc - location data.
rs - resources: tags, images, texts, colors.
tv - title/view information.
wg - word groups.
wk - works.
