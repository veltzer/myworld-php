Here is how to upgrade wordpress...
===================================
- If you want to do it through the wp admin then run the
	wp_unlock_full.sh script to open up everything.
- from the admin tell it to upgrade (if you ran the script as
	in the previous stage it will not give you any problems).
- after the upgrade remember to remove the hello dolly plugin.
- you should see that you are using the new wordpress version from
	the admin dashboard panel.
- there is an chance that you are overriding various images or the like.
	(in my case the rss icon) of the default installation of wp.
	If so, then override them again (hopefuly you save them before
	this whole process of upgrade began...).
