stats problem:
	the length of all movies seen is not really correct: it does not count movies seen more than once.
	Add that statistic and make the current one explain itself better.
	the pagination in my table on the website seems wrong (look at page 30 or so). fix it.

old file problem:
	there is one minor file in the still not done folder.
	do it and then get ridd of the whole folder. 

blog:
	add stat to the blog with movies which imdb could not be found for and those for which it could.
	add date+imdbid (this is what I want to show) stat to the blog.
	add description of devices on which I'm seeing movies to the blog.
	put an update in the text of my movies section about the MaxHD.
	show movies with no reviews too.

data cleanup:
	look at highest rated movies and see if they deserve it. Clean it up.
	do a script that finds doubly linked views (views which are too close together
	of the same movie). Clean up the data if it finds any.

add script to check director names for films with imdb and director name.
	(have it put new directory names in).
	check all director names and fix them up.

length problem in series.
	Look at "Yes, Minister" as an example. My system deduces
	it's lenght at 60 mins (which is absurd). The output from Imdb
	is quite complex and needs to be processed somehow...
