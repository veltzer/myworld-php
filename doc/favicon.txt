This is documentation about using the favicon here...
=====================================================
- Ultimately the favicon should be in the database.
- Currently it is not.
- My first solution was to put it here in the build directory (not as part of any wordpress
plugin but rather as a standalone file) and have the "make install" process install it
at the root of my website (usually /var/www).
- This was a stupid solution since it is too much hardcoded.
- I found, by scanning wordpress plugins that deal with the favicon issue, that there is
a way for a page to set it's own favicon.
- This is done by a syntax like this:
	echo "<link rel='SHORTCUT ICON' type='image/x-icon' href='".plugins_url('resources/favicon.ico',__FILE__)."' />\n";
- This is how I got to the current situation: the favicon is part of the plugin (still not in the database) but has nothing to do with the build system. Better.

What about favicon in areas which are not of the blog?
======================================================
several options:
1. drop a copy of 'favicon.ico' in the root of the site (usually /var/www).
	This is not nice since there needs to be some way of automatically doing it
	and it duplicates the icon.
2. create an mod_rewrite rule which does "favicon.ico -> where it really is".

Solution (2) is more flexible since it lends itself to ultimately storing the favicon
in the database (which is where we want to go...).
That's why it was chosen.

What is yet to do ?
- put the favicon in the database.
- put the right link to the GetBlob.php script instead of it's name.
- get it out of the plugin (make the plugin lighter).
	and put the download url in the plugin.
- put the same download url in the htaccess file.
