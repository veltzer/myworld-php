This is documentation about using the favicon here...
=====================================================
- Ultimately the favicon should be in the database.
- How to do that is debatable (need to check out the favicon plugin for wordpress
	and see how these guys accomplish this task).
- Meanwhile the favicon is here inside the misc folder and gets installed using
	the makefile on issuing "make install".
