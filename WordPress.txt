This document describes the integration between my code and wordpress
=====================================================================
Goals:
- That I could develop my code with no regard to wordpress.
- That my code could know if it is running inside wordpress or not in order to
	produce different output of required for wordpress.
- That it would be easy to run my php code from within wordpress.

What you have to do in wordpress in order to run my php code:
=============================================================
1. install some php execute plugin that allows you to execute php code as
	part of posts or comments.
2. add
	<?php
		require("wp-setup.php");
		// now you can require any of my files using php related path names
		// and use any of my functions...
	?>
