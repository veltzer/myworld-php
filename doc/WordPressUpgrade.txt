Here is how to upgrade wordpress...
===================================
- If you want to do it through the wp admin then run the
	wp_unlock_full.sh script to open up everything.
- from the admin tell it to upgrade (if you ran the script as
	in the previous stage it will not give you any problems).
- after the upgrade remember to remove the hello dolly plugin.
- you should see that you are using the new wordpress version from
	the admin dashboard panel.
