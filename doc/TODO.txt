- make a script that installs my blog from scratch:
	It opens wp-3.0, adds all the plugins and themes, and adds any needed configuration
	files etc...
	This will enable me to make an easy script to transfer my blog to another host.

- divide my plugin into two plugins:
	- one that handles the hebrew stuff.
	- one that handles the myworld stuff.
	- blog about the hebrew plugin.

- comments issues:
	comments do not look good if they are on hebrew posts.
	They do not have hebrew translations.
	They do not by default accepts right to left text.

- reinstall my blog and see exactly what is needed to get it to it's current state.
- write a script that copies the blog to a remote machine (veltzer.org for instance).

- import all company images into my database.
- permalinks look bad. A link to an article looks like:
	http://veltzer.net/blog/blog/2010/07/02/grep-is-broken-use-perl-instead/
	The extra "blog" there is redundant. Do something about it.
	this is because of the multi-site feature - when I'll get ridd of it the
	permalinks will be better.
- fix up my favicon after learning some gimp howto.
- GetBlob.php should be based on include/blob.php
	and so should be lilypond fragment.
	There I would have sugar functions for creating a link for a blog
	and extracting the data of a blob requested.
- add google analytics to GetBlob.php.
- take an image of me and pass it though some gimp folder and put it on the side bar
	of my site.
- put some info on the about page.
- put a todo page on the blog with stuff that I want to do in the blog
	and handle it from there.
- check what's the status of a hebrew spell checker in my blog...
	(do I have one ? does it work? what about the english one ?)
- add images to my political posts (the hebrew ones).

- icon for the site should be built and installed with "make install".
- Alternating colors in table so that they could be better read.

Theme issues:
- Make the sidebar to the right go all the way to the top.
