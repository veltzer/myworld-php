- when mouse overs over titles which have been changed to hebrew by this
plugin then it shows not only the content of the title but also the wrapping
div. make this behave better.

- this plugin is over simplistic in it's approach - it simply scans the text for
hebrew. Allow the user to say what is hebrew or what is not using a tag.

- allow comments in hebrew.

- comments issues:
	comments do not look good if they are on hebrew posts.
	They do not have hebrew translations.
	They do not by default accepts right to left text.
	Make my hebrew plugin handle this...

- take a loot at hebrew4wp at http://hebrew4wp.nadav.org/.
	Maybe I can get some ideas from there...

- in the css unite the three style so the content of these styles will be written once
(how do you do that ?!?)
